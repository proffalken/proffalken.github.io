  company: Mockingbird Consulting Ltd
  summary: |
    A specialist IoT Managed Service Provider focusing on the agricultural sector, Mockingbird Consulting deployed a global IoT network based on LoRaWAN for use by farmers and vinters in the UK, EU, China, and Australia.
    Leaning heavily on DevOps best practice, the infrastructure was managed via Hashicorp's <a href="https://nomadproject.io/">Nomad</a>, with <a href="https://consul.io/">Consul</a> for internal service discovery and <a href="https://vaultproject.io/">Vault</a> for secrets management including auto-rotation of various credentials.
    Unfortunately a combination of Brexit and COVID-19 led to a situation in which operating was no longer viable, and the company was closed in October 2020.
