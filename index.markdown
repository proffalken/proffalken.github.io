<p>In short, I'm a geek.</p>
<p>I love technology and the opportunities that it brings to enhance and improve people's lives.</p>
<p>I have a borderline obsession for all things Observability, from monitoring servers and applications through to home automation and tracking livestock and farm machinery, and if I can measure or monitor something in my life then the chances are I already have!</p>
<p>I'm also a dad, husband, and guitarist, so when I'm not writing code I'm usually walking the dog or trying to improve my guitar playing.</p>
<p>If you're ever wandering the streets looking for something to do, and you see a bloke with a guitar asking if there's an Open Mic Night in the area, it's quite possibly me!</p>
